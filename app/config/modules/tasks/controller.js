//The name of the controller should be plural that matches with your API, ending with ControllerExtension. 
//Example: your API is http://localhost:8080/api/tasks then the name of the controller is tasksControllerExtension.
//To register this controller, just go to app/config/routes.js and add 'tasks' in 'easyRoutes' or 'autoRoutes' array.
//
//The main difference in 'easyRoutes' and 'autoRoutes' is that 'autoRoutes' generates complete CRUD pages, where as in 'easyRoutes'
//you need to provide templates inside 'app/modules/tasks' folder. If you want to keep your templates somewhere else, you can pick
//'autoRoutes' and then override the templates using setTemplate function.
//Note that for 'autoRoutes', it is not even required to write Controller Extensions unless you want to modify the behaviour.
